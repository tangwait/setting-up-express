This was a coding lesson about setting up express.

In this lesson, I learned:

  to set up express in a structural/efficient way (MVC)
  basic ejs syntax
  to connect app.js with route/controller/view + how they interact together
  to set up links/constants and pass them through MVC
  adding resusable templates to pass into static html
  middleware functions
  error handling
